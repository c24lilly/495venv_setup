    "Almost all deep learning methods are based on gradient descent, which means that the network being optimized needs to be differentiable. Deep neural networks are usually built using rectified linear or sigmoid neurons, as these are differentiable nonlinearities. However, in neurmorphic modelling we often want to use spiking neurons, which are not differentiable. So the challenge is how to apply deep learning methods to spiking neural networks.\n",
    "\n",
    "A method for accomplishing this is presented in Hunsberger and Eliasmith (2016). The basic idea is to use a differentiable approximation of the spiking neurons during the training process, and the actual spiking neurons during inference. NengoDL will perform these transformations automatically if the user tries to optimize a model containing a spiking neuron model that has an equivalent, differentiable rate-based implementation. In this example we will use these techniques to develop a network to classify handwritten digits (MNIST) in a spiking convolutional network."
